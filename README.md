# Chrome Extension `manifest.json` Dataset
This repository contains [`manifest.json`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) files (as well as associated store metadata) extracted from Chrome extensions from the [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). 

This dataset is [automatically updated](./.github/workflows/release.yml) every day. It's meant to be useful for analysis of the Chrome extension ecosystem, such as what permissions are requested, common Content Security Policies, etc.

This repository was directly inspired by [mandatoryprogrammer/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset).
